## Underlying Data
All consensus sequences generated in this study are available in the `ARTIC-HELP_consensus-fasta.zip` archive. This file contains the following directories:

- **`stage1_sars_cov_2_consensus/`**  
  SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences from the stage 1, workflows 1–6.  
  Includes a control panel with four RNA concentrations derived from a lab-grown isolate  
  (*SARS-CoV-2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ001/2020*).

- **`stage2_sars_cov_2_consensus/`**  
  SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences from the stage 2. Includes a control panel with four RNA concentrations  
  derived from a lab-grown isolate (*SARS-CoV-2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ001/2020*).

- **`stage3_sars_cov_2_consensus/`**  
  SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences from the stage 3, clinical panel of 19 samples  
  processed using three workflows: **LoCost**, **HELP-Ie (Platinum)**, and **HELP-IIe (EcoDry)**.

- **`stage3_norovirus_gii_consensus/`**  
  Norovirus GII consensus sequences from the stage 3, clinical panel of 12 samples  
  processed using three workflows: **LoCost**, **HELP-Ie (Platinum)**, and **HELP-IIIe (Q5)**.

##  Description

This data supports evaluation of **ARTIC-HELP**  
(**H**omebrew **E**nzymes for **L**ibrary **P**reparation), designed as a flexible alternative to ARTIC LoCost protocol. HELP offers open-source substitutes for all key enzymatic steps in the native barcoding workflow (ONT), including end-repair, barcode ligation, and adapter ligation, making the workflow broadly applicable to any laboratory using nanopore sequencing. 
The goal is to complement (not replace) commercial mixes with practical options that most molecular biology labs already have on hand.

Study Aim: Reducing supply chain dependencies for viral sequencing using ARTIC-HELP workflows
