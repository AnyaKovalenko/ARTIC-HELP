##  Description

This dataset supports the evaluation of **HELP workflows** for amplicon-based sequencing using **off-the-shelf commercial enzymes** as alternatives to standard reagents in the ARTIC protocol. These results provide evidence for more **supply-resilient, cost-effective genomic surveillance strategies**, especially in resource-constrained or decentralized lab settings.
